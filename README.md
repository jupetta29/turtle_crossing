# Turtle Crossing
> Taking this turtle out of its slow and steady comfort zone!
 
There are a whole ton of cars driving along a super busy multi-lane highway. The player's task is to get this turtle across the road without dying as many times possible.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get Turtle Crossing up &
running.

```shell
# N/A
```

At this time, there are no modules/packages needed for installation to get started.

## Features

* As the player continues to succeed in getting the turtle to the other side, the game will continue leveling up with even faster cars!
